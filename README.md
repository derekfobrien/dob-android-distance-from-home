# An app to calculate your distance from home
This is an app that was written for Android-based tablets and smartphones, written in XML and Java.

The app uses GPS to calculate the distance from your current location to that of your home location, which you can also set. The distance displayed is "as the crow flies", i.e. a straight line between the two points.

It tells you if you are within or outside the 2km limit, by means of changing the colour of the text indicating the distance.

This is in accordance with the Covid-19 lockdown in Ireland, introduced on the 27th March 2020, in an attempt to slow down the coronavirus. The regulations under which this order was imposed state that you are supposed to stay within 2km of your home, except if you need to carry out specified essential tasks.

Another facility on this app that you may have noticed is that there is a switch below the "Set as Home Coordinates" button. This is used to determine the number of decimal places to which the latitude and longitude is displayed.
